1. What is Model-Based Development?
    => Model-based design / development (MBD) is a software development methodology.
    => It is the practice of leveraging simulation to understand the behavior of a system.
    => This system may be already existing or needs to be constructed.
    => MBD focuses on creating mathematical models.
    => These models represent the system behavior and generate system code.
    => MBD reduces time-to-market and ensures early error detection.

2. What is a Model?
    => A model is a representation of a real system focusing on some important aspects.
    => It is a graphical representation of a system.

    | Aspect                  | Model-Based Development                      | Code-Based Development                                           |
    | Approach                | Focuses on creating mathematical models      | Direct manual coding of software                                 |
    | Complexity Management   | Manages inherent complexity efficiently      | Manual coding can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain structures   |
    | Maintainability         | Simplifies function structure maintenance    | Code-focused approach may complicate maintenance                 |
    | Portability             | Easier portability to other microcontrollers | Challenges in porting large code bases to new platforms          |
    | Development Time        | Reduces time-to-market                       | May result in longer development cycles                          |
    | Testing Integration     | Testing performed at every step, iterative   | Testing often concentrated in later phases, costlier corrections |
    | System-Level Simulation | Allows for early system-level simulation     | Relies on prototypes for system integration                      |
