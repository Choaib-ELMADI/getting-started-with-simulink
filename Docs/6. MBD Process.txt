1. Model Development Process:
    => The MBD process consits of four main stages:
        . Requirements:
            - Understand what the system should do (inputs, outputs, constraints).
            - Write the requirements in a simple and clear way so they can be tested later.
            - Make sure all requirements are measurable, complete, and agreed on.

        . Design:
            - Create block diagrams or models that represent how the system will work.
            - Break the system into smaller functions to make it easier to manage.
            - Check that the design matches the requirements before moving forward.

        . Implementation:
            - Convert the model into real code automatically or manually.
            - Integrate the generated code into the target hardware (MCU, controller, etc.).
            - Make sure the code meets performance, memory, and timing needs.

        . Testing:
            - Simulate the model to see if it behaves as expected.
            - Test the generated code on hardware (HiL, SiL, MiL depending on the stage).
            - Validate that the final system satisfies all requirements.

2. MBD through V-Model:
    => View image: ./Images/mbd-through-v-model.png

    => MiL: Model-in-the-Loop:
        . Happens in a simulation environment and tests the model itself.

    => SiL: Software-in-the-Loop:
        . Happens in a simulation environment also and tests the code generated from the model.
