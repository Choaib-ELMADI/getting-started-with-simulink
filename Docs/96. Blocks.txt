==> Sine Wave                       : generate a sine wave signal
==> Gain                            : multiply a signal by a constant
==> Scope                           : visualize and monitor signals
==> Transfer Fct                    : the plant of a system

==> Dashboard Scope                 : visualize signals withen the same canvas (not in a new window)
==> Viewers                         : visualize and monitor signals
