. A finite state machine (FSM) is a mathematical model that represents a system with a limited number of states and transitions, based on external inputs.
    -> The machine has a predefined set of states.
    -> At any given time, the machine can only be in one exact state.
    -> Inputs are external events or signals that trigger the transition between states.
    -> Transitions are the rules that define how the machine moves between states, based on the current state and the input.
    -> Outputs are actions or signals that are generated by the machine's state transition. These are optional (depending on FSM type).
