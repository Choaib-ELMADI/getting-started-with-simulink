. States can have different action types:
    -> "entry:" or "en:"  : executes when the state is entered.
    -> "during:" or "du:" : executes when the state is active and there is no valid state transition.
    -> "exit:" or "ex:"   : executes when the state is active and a transition out occurs.
    -> "on event_name:"   : executes when the state is active and the event_name event occurs.
