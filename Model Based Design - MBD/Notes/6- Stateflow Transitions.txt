. A transition is a link between two graphical objects.
    -> Transition syntax:
        > event[condition]{condition_action;}/{transition_action;}

    -> The default transition is the main entry point to an FSM or a flow graph.
    -> The default transition has no condition.

    -> Multiple outgoing transitions are assigned priority numbers.
    -> The lower the number, the higher the priority.
    -> To change transition priority order, right click on that number -> Execution Order -> ...

    -> Junctions divide a transition into transition segments.
