. Conditions are boolean expressions that specify if a transition path is valid.
    -> A condition is part of the transition label.
    -> Conditions are identified by this '[]'.
    -> A condition can consist of multiple boolean expressions.
    -> Conditions can be created using:
        - Boolean data
        - Change detection operators
        - Return values of function calls
        - Comparison operators

. Stateflow Special Operators:
    -> Timing Operators:
        - before(x, tick) : Initially, the signal is at '1' and lasts x ticks before it changes to '0'.
        - at(x, tick)     : A pulse at the x-th tick.
        - after(x, tick)  : Initially, the signal is at '0' and changes to '1' after x ticks.
        - every(x, tick)  : A pulse every x ticks.

    -> Change Detection Operators:
        - hasChanged(VAR)                  : Check if a variable's value has changed.
        - hasChangedTo(VAR, targetVal)     : Check if a variable's value has changed to a target value.
        - hasChangedFrom(VAR, originalVal) : Check if a variable's value has changed from an original value.
