. A flow chart is a graphical construct that models logic patterns using connective junctions and transitions.
    -> Junctions provide decision branches between alternate transition paths.

. Basic Rules:
    => Conditions are drawn horizontally.
    -> The horizontal conditional path must always have priority '1'.
    => Condition actions are drawn vertically.
    -> Right-to-left horizontal transitions must be blank labeled or comment label only.
    -> Junctions must have an unconditional path (default transition).

. Pattern Generator:
    -> To generate a pattern:
        > Enter the Chart -> Right Click -> Add Pattern In Chart -> ...
